          <h3>Robert Lynch</h3>
          <p>When I'm not busy working on personal projects or absorbed in school work, I love running, playing video games, playing the piano, and relaxing with my friends watching movies. I wanted to help start LAN because I've always loved making new friends and spending time with them, but I never really felt there was a good place to do that as a CS major.</p>
