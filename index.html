    <h2>About Us</h2>
    <div id="about" class="section">
      <p>We are a co-ed social fraternity for Computer Science majors at the University of Texas at Austin. We will be accepting applications from all students currently pursuing a degree in CS. We are focused on social activities and building community in a laid back, enjoyable environment. We will have a simple rush and interview process where we will get to know you and determine if we think you will be a good fit.</p>

          <h3>Reid McKenzie</h3>
          <p>I pick locks, play tabletop games, predict branches and compile code. I wanted to help start Texas LAN because after three years in the CS department I wanted an extracurricular social group where I could meet and chill with other people from the major.</p>

          <h3>Robert Lynch</h3>
          <p>When I'm not busy working on personal projects or absorbed in school work, I love running, playing video games, playing the piano, and relaxing with my friends watching movies. I wanted to help start LAN because I've always loved making new friends and spending time with them, but I never really felt there was a good place to do that as a CS major.</p>

          <h3>Bri Connelly</h3>
          <p>I love dancing, binge watching horrible TLC reality shows, and iOS development. In my free time you’ll catch me at Ballet Austin, maybe chillin in the WiCS office, or browsing reddit. I’m very excited about Texas LAN because it’s a way for CS majors to stay connected outside of academics.</p>

          <h3>Claudio Wilson</h3>
          <p>I enjoy screaming at my computer when code doesn't compile, playing video games, listening to indie/future electronic music and long walks on the beach ;). I wanted to help get Texas LAN up and running because I wanted a close knit, like-minded group of people I could have fun with.</p>

          <h3>Greg Cerna</h3>
          <p>I enjoy 3D-printing useless objects, ironically saying yolo, being an android fanboy, buying obscure cryptocurrencies, and collecting chia pets. I'm helping start LAN because there is a disturbing lack of CS parties during roundup.</p>

          <h3>Andy Anderson</h3>
          <p>My time is spent checking facebook, reading up on how people programmed in the 1970s, listening to classical music, pointing fingers, and asking children to leave my lawn. While not being a horrible old man, I do community service with friends. I decided to join LAN in order to convince some more people that GOTO wasn’t that bad after all.</p>

          <h3>Masha Belyaeva</h3>
          <p>I was born in Russia and hold true to the indestructible nature of my people. Computer Science is actually my second major, radio-television-film being the first. If I am not making video games, then I am playing quidditch or soccer, and I bring the occasional snow day to Austin. Stories are my favourite thing about people and thus I am excited to have the opportunity to meet so many others through the creation of this organization.</p>

          <h3>Dan Rutledge</h3>
          <p>I have been a tinkerer ever since I could remember. I like theoretical politics and am pretty well versed in classical greek texts. I am also interested in the decipherments of lost languages and a bit on ancient linguistics. I am also on the board for the Turing Scholars Student Association. I believe in LAN because there is no other group with people like us at UT.</p>

          <h3>Josh Slocum</h3>
          <p>In my free time I enjoy competitive programming, computer graphics, basketball, ultimate frisbee, electronic music and video games. I have been rather disappointed with the lack of a designated place for CS majors to get to know each other outside of the classroom, relax, and have fun, so I wanted to help LAN be that place.</p>

          <h3>David Wetterau</h3>
          <p>I spend large quantities of my time programming for fun, doing distributed systems research, spending time outdoors, and playing video games and ultimate frisbee. Even though I take school way too seriously, I am very excited help start a social group for Computer Science students where we can all feel like a part of a community.</p>
