                                <p>When I'm not busy working on personal projects or absorbed in school work, I love running, playing video games, playing the piano, and relaxing with my friends watching movies. I wanted to help start LAN because I've always loved making new friends and spending time with them, but I never really felt there was a good place to do that as a CS major.</p>

                                <p>I love dancing, binge watching horrible TLC reality shows, and iOS development. In my free time you’ll catch me at Ballet Austin, maybe chillin in the WiCS office, or browsing reddit. I’m very excited about Texas LAN because it’s a way for CS majors to stay connected outside of academics.</p>

                                <p>My time is spent checking facebook, reading up on how people programmed in the 1970s, listening to classical music, pointing fingers, and asking children to leave my lawn. While not being a horrible old man, I do community service with friends. I decided to join LAN in order to convince some more people that GOTO wasn’t that bad after all.</p>

                                <p>I was born in Russia and hold true to the indestructible nature of my people. Computer Science is actually my second major, radio-television-film being the first. If I am not making video games, then I am playing quidditch or soccer, and I bring the occasional snow day to Austin. Stories are my favourite thing about people and thus I am excited to have the opportunity to meet so many others through the creation of this organization.</p>

                                <p>I have been a tinkerer ever since I can remember. I like theoretical politics and am pretty well versed in classical greek texts. I am also interested in the decipherments of lost languages and a bit on ancient linguistics. I am also on the board for the Turing Scholars Student Association. I believe in LAN because there is no other group with people like us at UT.</p>

                                <p>I spend large quantities of my time programming for fun, doing distributed systems research, spending time outdoors, and playing video games and ultimate frisbee.

                                <p>I enjoy 3D-printing useless objects, ironically saying yolo, being an android fanboy, buying obscure cryptocurrencies, and collecting chia pets. I'm helping start LAN because there is a disturbing lack of CS parties during roundup.</p>

                                <p>I love to be outdoors around no technology, but I think there are upsides to having multiple screens. I think phone hip-holsters are underappreciated and wedges are my favorite shoe invention. I enjoy buzzfeed quizzes and I always have at least 6 tabs open on my laptop at all times. I believe LAN is where you can meet some of your new best friends.</p>

                                <p>Sup. I've always yearned for a diverse lifestyle that gives me great opportunities; hence I'm here at UT Austin, and even more so in LAN. I love being a student, pursuing my interests in computer science, business/consulting, psychology, and economics. I've never been more excited for a new school year! I'm hoping to help LAN grow substantially with the help of my fellow officers and members, as well as opening my horizons to international travel, business, and projects.</p>

                                <p>I try on hats and think about the future. Added computer science as a second major during my sophomore year with no coding experience and no regrets. I like food trucks, machine learning, going to hackathons for fun, and using the Oxford comma. I believe LAN will inherit the earth.</p>

                                <p>Doing things differently interests me. Anytime I'm on Slack, I'm finding ways to fit emojis in conversations. Nothing makes me happier than a building something cool and implementing an idea. Knowing that I'm contributing to such a tight knit community drives my love for LAN, because Lambda Alpha Nu believes in Lambda Alpha You.</p>

                                <p>While Computer Science is my life and I wouldn't replace it with anything, cooking is my passion. Through Lambda Alpha Nu I have been able to expand beyond my expectations of both of these things. In my free time (ha) I enjoy watching sports, playing video games, and shoving my food, sometimes literally, down my friends' throats.</p>

                                <p>If you ever need me I will be in my apartment studying, playing video games or napping. I enjoy going to the gym to relieve stress and dancing with my friends in and outside of clubs. I decided to become a part of Texas LAN because I wanted to meet people who were in CS but not focus exclusively on CS-related activities. I ran for office because I truly loved it and the people in it during my first year and I want to help it flourish.</p>

Some say I’m the reason for the teardrops on Taylor Swift’s guitar. I’m glad LAN exists as it’s a great way for people to really connect with one another and become a family who cares for each other.</p>

When I’m not in bed on my laptop with no pants and all the lights off, you can find me petting the closest dog. I also play viola and guitar. I’m all about exploring Austin and spending way too much money on food. I love being a part of LAN and can’t wait to see what’s in our future!</p>
