					<p>I love to be outdoors around no technology, but I think there are upsides to having multiple screens. I think phone hip-holsters are underappreciated and wedges are my favorite shoe invention. I enjoy buzzfeed quizzes and I always have at least 6 tabs open on my laptop at all times. I believe LAN is where you can meet some of your new best friends.</p>

					<p>While Computer Science is my life and I wouldn't replace it with anything, cooking is my passion. Through Lambda Alpha Nu I have been able to expand beyond my expectations  of both of these things. In my free time (ha) I enjoy watching sports, playing video games, and shoving my food, sometimes literally, down my friends' throats.</p>

					<p>If you ever need me I will be in my apartment studying, playing video games or napping. I enjoy going to the gym to relieve stress and dancing with my friends in and outside of clubs. I decided to become a part of Texas LAN because I wanted to meet people who were in CS but not focus exclusively on CS-related activities. I ran for office because I truly loved it and the people in it during my first year and I want to help it flourish.</p>

					<p>Sup. I've always yearned for a diverse lifestyle that gives me great opportunities; hence I'm here at UT Austin, and even more so in LAN. I love being a student, pursuing my interests in computer science, business/consulting, psychology, and economics. I've never been more excited from a new school year! I'm hoping to help LAN grow substantially with the help of my fellow officers and members, as well as opening my horizons to international travel, business, and projects.</p>

Some say I’m the reason for the teardrops on Taylor Swift’s guitar. I’m glad LAN exists as it’s a great way for people to really connect with one another and become a family who cares for each other.</p>

If I am not making video games, then I am playing quidditch or soccer, and I bring the occasional snow day to Austin. Stories are my favourite thing about people and thus I am excited to have the opportunity to meet so many others through the creation of this organization.</p>
