    <h2>About Us</h2>
    <div id="about" class="section">
      <p>We are a co-ed social fraternity for Computer Science majors
      at the University of Texas at Austin. We will be accepting
      applications from all students currently pursuing a degree in
      CS. We are focused on social activities and building community
      in a laid back, enjoyable environment.</p>

          <h3>Reid McKenzie <span class="officerTitle">President</span></h3>
          <p>I pick locks, play tabletop games, predict branches and
          compile code. I wanted to help start Texas LAN because after
          three years in the CS department I wanted an extracurricular
          social group where I could meet and chill with other people
          from the major.</p>

          <h3>Robert Lynch <span class="officerTitle">VP of Administration</span></h3>
          <p>When I'm not busy working on personal projects or
          absorbed in school work, I love running, playing video
          games, playing the piano, and relaxing with my friends
          watching movies. I wanted to help start LAN because I've
          always loved making new friends and spending time with them,
          but I never really felt there was a good place to do that as
          a CS major.</p>

          <h3>Bri Connelly <span class="officerTitle">VP of Social Affairs</span></h3>
          <p>I love dancing, binge watching horrible TLC reality
          shows, and iOS development. In my free time you’ll catch me
          at Ballet Austin, maybe chillin in the WiCS office, or
          browsing reddit. I’m very excited about Texas LAN because
          it’s a way for CS majors to stay connected outside of
          academics.</p>

          <p>My time is spent checking facebook, reading up on how
          people programmed in the 1970s, listening to classical
          music, pointing fingers, and asking children to leave my
          lawn. While not being a horrible old man, I do community
          service with friends. I decided to join LAN in order to
          convince some more people that GOTO wasn’t that bad after
          all.</p>

          <p>I was born in Russia and hold true to the indestructible
          nature of my people. Computer Science is actually my second
          major, radio-television-film being the first. If I am not
          making video games, then I am playing quidditch or soccer,
          and I bring the occasional snow day to Austin. Stories are
          my favourite thing about people and thus I am excited to
          have the opportunity to meet so many others through the
          creation of this organization.</p>

          <p>I spend large quantities of my time programming for fun,
          doing distributed systems research, spending time outdoors,
          and playing video games and ultimate frisbee. Even though I
          take school way too seriously, I am very excited help start
          a social group for Computer Science students where we can
          all feel like a part of a community.</p>

          <p>I enjoy 3D-printing useless objects, ironically saying
          yolo, being an android fanboy, buying obscure
          cryptocurrencies, and collecting chia pets. I'm helping
          start LAN because there is a disturbing lack of CS parties
          during roundup.</p>
